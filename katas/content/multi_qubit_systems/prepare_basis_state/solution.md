The starting state can be represented as follows:
$$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \ket{0} \otimes \ket{0} $$

The goal state can be represented as follows:
$$ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \ket{1} \otimes \ket{1} $$

Applying an **X** gate to a qubit in the $\ket{0}$ state transforms the qubit state into the $\ket{1}$ state. So, if we apply the **X** gate on the first qubit and the second qubit, we get the desired state.
