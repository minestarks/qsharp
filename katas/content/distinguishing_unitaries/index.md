# Distinguishing Unitaries

@[section]({
    "id": "distinguishing_unitaries__overview",
    "title": "Overview"
})

This kata offers you a series of tasks in which you are given one unitary from the given list and have to figure out which one it is by designing and performing experiments on it.

**This kata covers the following topics:**

- quantum measurements,
- designing experiments to analyze behavior of unitary transformations.

**What you should know to start working on this kata:**

- Dirac notation for single-qubit and multi-qubit quantum systems
- Basic single-qubit and multi-qubit gates
- Quantum measurements and their effect on quantum systems
