**Input:** An operation that implements a single-qubit unitary transformation:
either the identity $I$ or the Pauli $X$ gate. 

**Output:**  0 if the given operation is the $I$ gate, 1 if the given operation is the $X$ gate.

The operation will have Adjoint and Controlled variants defined.
You can apply the given operation and its adjoint/controlled variants exactly **once**.
