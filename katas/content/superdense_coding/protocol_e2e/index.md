**Input:** Two classical bits to be transmitted.

**Goal:**
Put together the steps performed in previous tasks to implement the full superdense coding protocol:

- Prepare a Bell state.
- Encode the two classical bits in the state of the qubits by applying quantum gates to one qubit of the Bell state,
- Decode the two classical bits from the resulting state.
- Return the result of decoding.
