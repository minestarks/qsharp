We can put together the operations defined in the previous tasks to run superdense coding protocol end-to-end.

- Prepare a Bell state.
- Encode the two classical bits in the state of the qubits by applying quantum gates to one qubit of the Bell state,
- Decode the two classical bits from the resulting state.
- Return the result of decoding.
