# Distinguishing Quantum States

@[section]({
    "id": "distinguishing_states__overview",
    "title": "Overview"
})

This kata is designed to get you familiar with the concept of measurements and using them for analyzing quantum states and with Q# programming.

**This kata covers the following topics:**

- single-qubit measurements,
- distinguishing orthogonal and non-orthogonal states.

**What you should know to start working on this kata:**

- Dirac notation for single-qubit and multi-qubit quantum systems
- Basic single-qubit and multi-qubit gates
- Single-qubit quantum measurements and their effect on quantum systems
